# Fibonacci-generator-
I have created this Fibonacci generator using python programming language. This Fibonacci generator generates the Fibonacci series of a given number.


# Fibonacci Generator

A Python implementation of the Fibonacci sequence generator. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

## Features

- **Recursive Approach**: Generates the Fibonacci sequence using recursion, ideal for smaller ranges.
- **Iterative Approach**: Efficient loop-based method to generate large sequences.
- **Memoization Technique**: Optimized recursive approach to store already computed Fibonacci numbers and speed up the process.
- **Custom Range**: Allows users to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a user-specified range or limit.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amitpycode/Fibonacci-generator-.git
```

### Running the Script

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Fibonacci-generator-
```

Run the Python script:

```bash
python fibonacci.py
```

### Input

The program will prompt you to specify the number of terms or the upper limit for the Fibonacci sequence.

### Output

The Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number or limit will be displayed.

## Example

For an input of `5`, the output will be:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3
```

For an input of `10`, the output will be:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
```
